Kala is a component based 2D game engine powered by [Kha](https://github.com/KTXSoftware/Kha). The project is in its very early development and still a proof of concept but you can expect it to grow a lot in the future.

Kala aims for:

1. Ease of use.
2. Flexibility.
3. Reusability of code.

A lot of breaking changes are going on so the examples were removed. Proper examples and tutorials will be worked on when Kala approached a more stable, ready for production state.
